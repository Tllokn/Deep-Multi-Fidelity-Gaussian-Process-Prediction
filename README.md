# Deep-Multi-Fidelity-Gaussian-Process-Prediction


##### Brief Background

In daily life, we often encounter situations where it is difficult to obtain high-fidelity data during the training phase of some data predictions, such as changes in the earthâ€™s atmosphere and heat conduction data. But for these experiments, we can use artificially simulated physical models to obtain a large amount of data. But these artificially simulated data often have a gap with the real situation, that is, low-fidelity data. How to train a model with a large number of low-fidelity data obtained by simulation combined with very few high-precision high-fidelity data so that the model has a high correct rate of prediction for high-fidelity data has become a problem worthy of research.
